* 1st slide - give an "abstract", talk about tunnelling and impedance recovery, start with something, finish with something

* the main idea: CALCULATE SENSITIVITY which is decided by the responsivity, in order to measure it, we need to use a real circuit - so we need to know what is the embedding circuit

* Slide about TES - what's the output?Â voltage current DC signal

* heterodyne detectors: Call signal \nu RF , make clear IF signal is the difference


* make a point that the I-V


* explain more clearly why are we doing the impedance recovery. Should say impedance recovery is improtant for RESPONSIVITY!

* talk that "We want to calculate embedding impedance as an unknown". I'm going ot use the measured pumped I-V curve and compare it with the simulated pumped I-V curve. 

* TOO SHORT about the responsivity. Give one definition perhaps? of the power. Alternatively, explain which responsivity is ideal and which is not. 

* REMOVE NEP completely - not enough time!!!!!!!

* talk that \Delta Idc it's what responsivity is proportional to.  

* cut out at least 25 % of slides - time was 40:30 , maybe even a half

* just define what the AC tunelling current is

* Niobium critical temperature - can't use 9 kelvin, need 8, 7 kelvin, 4 kelvin is standard. Ghassan did a similar measurement at 300 mK.

* heating and proximity effct - don't use these words, don' say heating effect or proximity effect

* Delete the absolute value from the slide 31 - delete absolute value from Re Z, Im Z. 

* It's rotated at 100 Hz, but it's CHOPPED at like 100/5 (because of the window opening/closing)


* slide 10, there should be some caivty showing empty states on the RHS

* Cooper pair binding energy 2Delta, Delta falls for each quasiparticle. Quasiparticle is basically a fancy name for an electron

* tunnel from left to right into a favourable energy states

* please put numbers in the slides - 

* with SIS mixers - important - they can be used to do INTERFEROMETRY with telescopes. Biggest advantage of SIS technology compared to direct detectors. Interferometry allows us for much greater resolution.  - maybe don't include it because it doesnt' completely apply

* slide 9 - two possible slopes for the normal resistance. Fabrication artifact, group cannot explain yet. The artifacts related to structure of the aluminium, holes in the material...

* normal part - all Cooper pairs are broken

* SNIS - don't mention this in the talk, really confusing.

* is there  something in our junctions that makes the wider fit interval better? Or is it a phenomenon more generic and intrinsic to all SIS technology
